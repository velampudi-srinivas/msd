    <h1>Start of ODI career</h1>
    <hr size="3">
    <p>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper
       to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.The team
       also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents
       like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.
       With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05
       .Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.
       In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series.</p>
